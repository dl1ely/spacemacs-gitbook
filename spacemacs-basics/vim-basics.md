# Evil Basics

Evil is an Emacs package that provides Vim style editing and provide Vim keybindings throughout all major modes.

Vim style editing is arguably the most effective way for touch typists to use a text editor and you can easily edit much faster once you are practised.

Spacemacs Evil providing multiple editing states, minimising the keybindings required for specific tasks as well as adding great power and flexibility when editing text.

![Spacemacs States](/images/spacemacs-states-vim.png)

* **normal** - for manipulating and navigating existing text
* **insert** - for writing new text
* **visual** - for selecting blocks of text
* **iedit** - edit multiple regions (i.e. multiple cursors)
* **lisp** - structural editing for Clojure & Lisp style languages (e.g. slurp, barf)

First get familiar with **normal**, **insert** and **visual** states.  Then when you are comfortable, move on to **iedit** and **lisp** states.

Read the sections under [Vim Style editing](/editing/vim-style/) to take you beyond the basic Vim editing covered in the tutorial. The more often you use these keybindings, the sooner they will become ingrained.
