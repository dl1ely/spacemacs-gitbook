# Getting started with Spacemacs

With Emacs version 25.1 (or greater) installed, simply clone or download the Spacemacs configuration, first moving any existing `~/.emacs.d` Emacs configuration out of the way.

Use your favourite git client or the following command in a terminal window:

```
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

> ####Hint::Using Spacemacs develop branch for latest fixes
> The latest updates and fixes are available much sooner if you use the `develop` branch of Spacemacs. > In a terminal window, change to the `develop` branch using the following commands:
```bash
cd ~/.emacs.d/
git checkout develop
```
> The `develop` branch is very stable and its recommended that you use this branch for Spacemacs.


Then run Emacs as normal.  Spacemacs will start installing a few key packages and then go on to ask you how you want your Spacemacs.
