# Restart the REPL

You can keep a REPL open for days or even weeks for the same project.  Sometimes you want to start from scratch and remove all of the evaluated code from the REPL.

If you want to reset all the names in the REPL then use the command: `, s X` 



> ####HINT::Undefining functions and symbols
> Rather than restart the REPL, you can [undefine](/evaluating-clojure/undefine.md) a specific function or symbol.
