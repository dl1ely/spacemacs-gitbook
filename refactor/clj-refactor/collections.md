# Convert between collection types

Quickly convert an existing collection (list, map, vector, set) to a different collection type without breaking the structure of that collection (i.e without loosing the closing character)

Place the cursor on the opening character of the collection `( { [ #` and use one of the following commands


| Spacemacs      | Normal    | Emacs         | Command                        | Description               |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `SPC m r c  [` | `, r c [` | `C-c  C-r  [` | clojure-convert-to-vector      | convert  to  vector       |
| `SPC m r c  {` | `, r c {` | `C-c  C-r  {` | clojure-convert-to-map         | convert  to  map          |
| `SPC m r c  #` | `, r c #` | `C-c  C-r  #` | clojure-convert-to-set         | convert  to  set          |
| `SPC m r c  (` | `, r c (` | `C-c  C-r  (` | clojure-convert-to-list        | convert  to  list         |
| `SPC m r c  '` | `, r c '`  | `C-c  C-r  '` | clojure-convert-to-quoted-list | convert  to  quoted  list |

> ####Hint::Syntax not checked during refactor
> Collections are converted regardless of whether the resulting collection is of the correct structure.  For example, converting to a map does not check for balanced key-value pairs.  Neither does converting to a set check for unique values.
>
> These commands replace the previous cycle collection command from earlier versions of clj-refactor.
