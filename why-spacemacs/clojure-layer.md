# Clojure Layer Overview

The [Clojure layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/clojure) provides and full language support and tooling including, autocomplete, refactor, inspector and debugger, etc.

This layer supports Clojure projects managed by [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org), [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/) and [Clojure CALI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) (`deps.edn`).

> ####Hint::CIDER is part of the [Clojure layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/clojure)
> The [Clojure layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/clojure) is a collection of Emacs packages and curated configuration to ensure those packages work well together in Spacemacs. The biggest part of the [Clojure layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/clojure) is the [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) package.
> [Opening a Clojure file](/install-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html) or [adding the Clojure layer](/install-spacemacs/manually-add-clojure-layer.html) to Spacemacs will install the latest version of CIDER.


## Features of the Clojure layer

> ####TODO:: Tidy up this section

[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) provides a comprehensive range of tools to create quality Clojure code.

Starting a REPL (Clojure runtime environment) from Spacemacs allows you to evaluate one or more expressions and see the results in your code buffer, giving extremely fast feedback on the behaviour of your code.  You also have a separate REPL buffer that will evaluate expressions.
