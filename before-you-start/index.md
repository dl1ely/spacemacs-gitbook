# Before You Start with Spacemacs and Clojure development

## [Install Emacs](install-emacs.html)
Spacemacs is a communiy driven configuration for Emacs, so you need to install Emacs before you can use Spacemacs.

> ####Info::Minimum Emacs Version - 25.1
> This guide used the `develop` version of Spacemacs which requires Emacs 25.1 or greater

## [Install Clojure](install-clojure.html)

This guide uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) as the project automation tool for Clojure.  It will help you create and run projects, as well as create build assets (jars) for deployment.  This guide should also work for [the Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) or [boot build tools](http://boot-clj.com/)

Clojure is a hosted language, so requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), provided by installing the Java JRE or Java SDK.
