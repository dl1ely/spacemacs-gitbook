# Linting - automatically highlighting code issues

> #### TODO::Work in progress

Common linting tools includes

* [Joker](https://github.com/candid82/joker) - standalone tool, simple to use, not Clojure complete though.
* [Eastwood](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood) - leiningen plugin
    * [squiggly-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/squiggly-clojure) to run Eastwood automatically from Emacs (repeatedly reloads your code in the repl, so need to ensure your code is happy with that).
