# Navigating using markers

Markers are used to create adhoc places to jump to in your buffer.

`m` and a character defines the name of the marker.  For example, `m a` defines a marker called `a`

`'` and a character jumps to that marker, so `' a` jumps to the marker called `a`

> #### Hint::
> Marker names are case-specific, so in theory you have have up to 52 markers.
>
> In practice, its likely you will only use less than 7 (after which you may forget what those markers were for).
