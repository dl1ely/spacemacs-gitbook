# Lisp State

> The lisp state commands are provided by the [Evil Lisp State](https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-lisp-state) package.

Lisp state provides and Evil mode for structural editing Clojure code and for other lisps too.  This mode provides a fast an convienient way to manipulate the structure of your Clojure whist keeping it valid, i.e. avoiding unbalanced parenthesis.

> ####Hint::
> In __Lisp State__ you do not need to use the `SPC k` keybinding, just the single character keybings.

The common lisp state commands I use are

| Lisp state `SPC k` | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `s` /  `S`         | slurp forwards / backwards - pull in code from the right / left      |
| `b` / `B`          | barf forwards / backwards - push out code to the right / left        |
| `d x`              | delete expression                                                    |
| `r`                | raise expression - replace parent expression with current expression |



## Using Lisp State

In a buffer containing a Clojure file, open the **lisp-state** using `SPC k .`

In Lisp state the window number has a pink background.

> ####Hint:: `SPC` does not activate Spacemacs menu
> In **lisp-state** the leader key, `SPC`, is not bound to the Spacemacs menu.  However, you can use the holy mode binding, `M-m`, to open the Spacemacs menu.

I am still learning lisp state myself, so in the mean time here is an interesting video from [Spacemacs ABC](https://youtu.be/ZFV5EqpZ6_s?list=PLrJ2YN5y27KLhd3yNs2dR8_inqtEiEweE)

## Moving around

| lisp-state | Description                        |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| `j`        | Next closing delimiter parenthesis |
| `k`        | Previous opening parenthesis       |
| `h`        | Backward symbol                    |
| `H`        | Backward sexp                      |
| `l`        | Forward symbol                     |
| `L`        | Forward sexp                       |


## Lisp State Commands

Adds a new [evil][evil-link]state to navigate lisp code and edit sexp trees using mnemonic key bindings.

To execute a command while in normal state, a leader key is used.  By default any command when executed sets the current state to `lisp state`.

Examples:

- to slurp three times while in normal state:

    `SPC k` 3 s

- to wrap a symbol in parenthesis then slurping two times:

    `SPC k` w 2 s

## Manual Configuration (optional)

Spacemacs  binding comes with the package, you have to explicitly
bind the lisp state to a key with the function `evil-lisp-state-leader`
For instance:

```elisp
(evil-lisp-state-leader ", SPC k")
```

Key bindings are set only for `emacs-lisp-mode` by default. It is possible to
add major modes with the variable `evil-lisp-state-major-modes'.

It is also possible to define the key bindings globally by setting
`evil-lisp-state-global` to t. In this case `evil-lisp-state-major-modes' has no
effect.

If you don't want commands to enter in `lisp state` by default set the variable
`evil-lisp-state-enter-lisp-state-on-command` to nil. Then use the
<kbd><leader> .</kbd> to enter manually in `lisp state`
