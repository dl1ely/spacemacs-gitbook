# Showing Intermediary values - Enlighten mode

As a homage to [LightTable](https://lighttable.com) live evaluation, you can enable `enlighten` minor mode to show the intermediary values during evaluation.

This provides a basic version of the Clojure inspector which is always on (until you toggle it off).
