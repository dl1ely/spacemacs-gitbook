# Managing Windows

Windows in Spacemacs allow you to organise your buffers, splitting horizontally and vertically with multiple rows and columns.  Windows can also be move around and resized without resorting to using the mouse.

The windows menu is `SPC w`.

`SPC w u` will undo a change to the windows.

> ####Hint::Golden Ratio
> Using the golden ratio mode automatically increases the size of the active window, which is very useful when you have multiple windows open.
> Toggle golden ratio mode using `SPC t g`


## Windows Transient menu

Use the Windows Transient state menu `SPC W .` to re-arrange windows multiple times.
