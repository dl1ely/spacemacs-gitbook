# Searching Projects

`SPC /` will do a fuzzy logic search of all the files in the current project.  A helm pop-up displays and allows you to type in a search term.

Use `C-j` and `C-k` to move down and up through the search results.

`RET` selects the search result and shows the file and line in the current buffer.


## Requirements - ripgrep search tool

Searching requires an external tool to be available on your system PATH. [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is the recommended search tool, although you can use silver searcher (ag) and grep.

## Searching specific files

To narrow the results you can specify a filename extension that you want to search through or ignore.

Ripgrep takes the `-g` option for a filename to search (globbing), or `-g!` for a filename to ignore.

`-g*.clj map` shows only results of searching for `map` from files ending in `.clj`

`-g!*.md map` will search for `map` for all files except those ending in `.md`
