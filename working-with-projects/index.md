# Working with Projects

Spacemacs gives you several options for managing the files in your project and you will use commands from the following menus


## File menu

**File menu** contains general functions such as find, copy, delete, rename, sudo-edit, bookmarks.

Once one file is open from a project you can use the **Project** menu to open other files, `SPC p f`

Read the [Reference: Projectile](/reference/projectile.html) for more details.



## File browsers / managers

[NeoTree](neotree.html) and [Ranger](ranger.html) are file managers that help you browse through files and directories.
