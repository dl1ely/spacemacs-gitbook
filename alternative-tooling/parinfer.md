# Alternative Tooling - Parinfer

The recommended Structural editing approach with Spacemacs is to use smartparens and if using Vim style editing evil-cleverparens.  These packages follow the paredit style of structural editing.

[Parinfer for Emacs](https://github.com/DogLooksGood/parinfer-mode) is self described as a simpler way to write lisp (but only if you are not used to paredit style, then you may find parinfer annoying)

Please read the [parinfer for emacs documentation](https://github.com/DogLooksGood/parinfer-mode) before [adding the parinfer layer](http://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+misc/parinfer/README.html), to ensure you understand the approach it takes.
