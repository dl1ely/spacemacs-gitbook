# Stashing changes

`z` opens the Stash menu, allowing you to keep changes in your working directory or staging index without having to commit them.  Stashing your local changes allows you to change to a different branch or pull commits from a remote repository.

`z` will stash all the changes in your local working directory and everything you have staged.

`i` stashes the changes that are staged, `w` stashes only the working directory
