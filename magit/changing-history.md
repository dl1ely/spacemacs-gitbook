# Changing History

> #### TODO::work in progress, sorry

The need to change history in Git should be minimal and should limited to fixing errors made in previous commits on your local repository.

Here are a few simple tools to help you change your local history.

> #### Hint:: Consentual Shared Remote History rewriting
> If you need to change commit history on a share repository then think about how many people it is going to affect.  If you really must change a shared git history, get consent from the people you will affect first.

> It is much simpler to commit a new change that fixes the omission or error and let others pull that additional change.


## Amend commit

This creates a new commit with both the currently staged changes and the change in the previous commit.

If you forgot to include some changes in the last commit, then this is a way to avoid two commits for the same logical change.
