# MaGit - Version Control

> #### TODO::work in progress, sorry

Magit is a very powerful and simple to use client for Git version control.

Here is a quick demonstration of Magit in action where we stage and commit changes locally, then push those commits to [Github](https://github.com)

> #### Hint::Closing multiple Magit buffers
> Magit buffers tend to hang around if you keep Spacemacs open for days (or weeks/months).  The Helm transient state menu quickly delete them for you.
>
> `SPC b b` to open all buffers.
> Type `magit` in the helm prompt to show just the magit buffers
> `M-SPC` opens the Helm Transient state
> `T` marks all buffers
> `M-D` deletes all marked buffers (and closes the Helm transient state)
