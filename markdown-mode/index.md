# Markdown Mode

## Collapse or expand headings

To navigate longer documents more effectively, you can expand and collapse sections of your markdown content, showing only those heading or sub-headings and content you are working with.

| Keybinding | Description       |
|------------|-------------------|
| `TAB`      | expand headings   |
| `S-TAB`    | collapse headings |
